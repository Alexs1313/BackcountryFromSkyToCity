    description: `Milford Sound is one of New Zealand’s most famous fjords, nestled among the remote mountains of Fiordland National Park. Majestic cliffs rise vertically from the shimmering dark waters for over a thousand meters, creating an incredible sense of the harsh beauty of nature. The crystal-clear water mirrors the sky, and the sun’s rays break through the thick sea mist that descends from the mountaintops. The fjord is home to many rapid waterfalls - the Stirling Falls, which falls from a height of over a hundred meters, is particularly picturesque. Tourists can explore the luminous caves, observe colonies of Peruvian fur seals and a variety of waterfowl, which makes a trip here a real adventure. A guided fjord cruise reveals the secrets of the region’s geology and offers a chance to experience the harmony of man and wildlife over several hours of exciting sailing.`,

Photographers and filmmakers come here to shoot incredible shots.
